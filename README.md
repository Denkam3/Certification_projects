# Certification_projects
This repository contains projects needed for certificate on FreeCodeCamp.
Projects are made to pass the tests and can be edited in the future for more practice.
The tests that they had to pass were aimed on funcionality rather than design. Design will be slowly improved.
Some may contain more code than necessary but it will serve as a reminder of my own progress.
